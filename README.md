## KP to IMDB migration tool
This utility allows you to scrape your watchlist and ratings from russian movie database website Kinopoisk and add this data to the IMDB.
In order to make it work you need to create **credentials.py** in the root folder and set credential variables there:
```
kp_login = ...
kp_password = ...
kp_nickname = ...

imdb_email = ...
imdb_password = ...
imdb_nickname = ...
```
Then you may run **main.py** and choose needed function. After you finished exporting watchlist/ratings data from KP, you need to use appripriate parsing function before adding this data to IMDB.
